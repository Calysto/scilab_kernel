A Jupyter kernel for Scilab

Install as `pip install scilab_kernel`.

See the installation instructions for `scilab2py <http://blink1073.github.io/scilab2py/source/installation.html>`_ and `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`_, which are dependencies.

You should have a `Scilab` entry under "New" on the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.

It supports command history, the ``?`` help magic and calltips,
plotting, and completion.  You can toggle inline plotting using ``%inline``.

For details of how this works, see Jupyters's docs on `wrapper kernels
<http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/wrapperkernels.html>`_.
